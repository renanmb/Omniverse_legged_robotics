# yobotics_teleop
yobotics Quadruped Robot's teleoperation node. This is a forked version of [teleop_twist_keyboard](https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard/blob/master/teleop_twist_keyboard.py). 

The software has been modified to control the robot's whole-body pose (roll, pitch, yaw).
