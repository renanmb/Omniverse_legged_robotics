> Author Notes:
> As part of the [Spot Micro](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) community, I saw the opportunity for adding this project into Nvidia Omniverse ecosystem for those who wanted an easy and extremely powerfull simulator to try things out without risking damage to their robots.<br/>
> As an extension of that, now there is support to train the robot in the Omniverse Isaac Gym Reinforcement Learning Environments for Isaac Sim also known as [OmniIsaacGymEnvs - OIGE](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs)<br/>
